Project Background
==================

At Knacc we're currently developing premium themes for WordPress.

For our first project Show+Tell we wanted to use some nice iconography, however, most of the existing icon sets we explored weren't continuous and also didn't fit entirely with our style. So we set our lead designer the challenge of designing our very own set of icons.

The result is Knacc Icons, a set of free icons that have continuity and a style that can fit with any kind of project, whether it's for a web, app or print project. We'll keep adding more icons as we go, and we hope you can use Knacc icons in your own projects. Enjoy!
